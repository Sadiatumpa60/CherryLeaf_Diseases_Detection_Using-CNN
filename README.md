# CherryLeaf_Diseases_Detection_Using-CNN
This project is all about cherry leaf diseases detection.We are try to classify a partiucular cherry leaf diseases named powdery Mildew.Powdery mildews are easily recognized by the white, powdery growth of the fungus on infected portions of the cherry plant host. The powdery appearance results from the superficial growth of the fungus as thread-like strands (hyphae) over the plant surface and the production of chains of spores (conidia).We are trying to classify whether the leaf is infected or not.
